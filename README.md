# C-Sharp-R.A.T-Server
This is the server program of the c# R.A.T.
You will need to run this program on your computer, and not on the targets.
The targets will connect to you with the hlp of this program.
This is not a virus but serval AV will flag it as it's a virus.
Sorry you need to trust me or don't use the executable and build your own project from this source code.
The executable is NOT published on this site, if you want the .exe you have to build it using Visual Studio.
The .dll files are published, because the project will not start withuot them.
You need to allow firewall or the program can't open the TCP Server.

Contains the basic features like:
Remote Desktop, Keylogger, mic and cam spy, DDoS, fun menu, remote cmd prompt, process manager, file manager.
This software is open source, you can use the code, or pieces of it in your own project.
Or you can just use my project and change the needed values.

Happy Coding!
